let num=122;
let str="ser"
let dec=false
let fr;//undefined. this means type is not yet defined
let saf=null // means this defined as null and it is empty.
//ex: if we call temperature api but it didnot give any value then we cant keep it as 0. 
// because 0 is an temp. here temp =null  makes sense


//null and undefined are also data types. null means it is a stand alone value and undenfied means this is not yet defined.
//bigint is also datatype
//symbol datatype.this is for unique
//tc39.es is offical js documentation
